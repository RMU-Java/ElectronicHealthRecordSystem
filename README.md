# ElectronicHealthRecordSystem

###MIS 525:  Object Oriented Programming   Final Project

_The goal of the project is to deploy the different object oriented concepts studied in class to build one integrated application that simulates a real world problem. The project will be implemented using the Java programming language._

_This is a Electronic Health Record System With Appointment Scheduler that manages patient records and tracks patient-doctor appointments. Information related to both tasks can be manipulated as well as queried. In this project, the different programming concepts learned in Java including files, arrays, loops, GUI, objects and classes will be used to address the functions performed by the medical information system._

###Files
*  _This project will use files to maintain the system and patient information._

###Arrays

###Loops

###GUI
*  _Java GUI capabilities will be used to display windows to for input, modify patient information and display results of queries for retrieval of information._
